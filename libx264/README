This package is part of x264 program, which is downloaded from:
    ftp://ftp.videolan.org/pub/videolan/x264/snapshots/x264-snapshot-20140525-2245-stable.tar.bz2

libx264 extract the static library part of the x264 project.


The following is the source code file to generate obj file 
according the Makefile:

common/mc.c
common/predict.c
common/pixel.c
common/macroblock.c
common/frame.c
common/dct.c
common/cpu.c
common/cabac.c
common/common.c
common/osdep.c
common/rectangle.c
common/set.c
